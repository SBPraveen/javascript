    This is because JS considers "a" as a octal literal

    so a + b = 16 + 10 => 26

If the octal literal contains a number that is out of range(above 8), JavaScript ignores the leading 0 and treats the octal literal as a decimal

//!Note you can use the octal literals in non-strict mode. If you use them in strict mode, JavaScript will throw an error.
