//Code comments:
//|| Eg 1:
i += 2
//incrementing i
/*
Any developer would know that incrementing i.
So the proper way to comment is instead of commenting what you are doing, comment why you are doing
*/
//Eg:
i += 2
// incrementing i by 2 because we want i to be even nos.

//|| Eg 2:
let asd = (no1, no2) => no1 + no2
//*Proper way to comment
//Here no1 and no2 can be a number or a string. "asd" is a function to add numbers or concat two strings
