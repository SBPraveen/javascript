/** 
    Js has 8 built in types => 7 primitives + object

**2. Primitive types in javascript 
    1. undefined => This is the default value in any variable or property if no other value is present
    2. string 
    3. number
    4. boolean
    5. symbol 
    6. null
    7. bigint

**3. 
Arrays, functions are subtypes of objects

**4. 
In javascript variables don't have types but it is the values that have types. So variables can hold any values at any time. The variable which was holding a value of the type number in the next assignment statement can hold a value of the type string.(This is not possible in languages like C where "int varName = 20" after which varName can hold only integers)

**5.
In JS the type of the value assigned to a variable decides whether the value stored is assign by value or assign by reference
In JS all the primitive types are value assignments(pass by value) whereas the non primitives(compound values) such as objects, arrays, functions etc are reference assignments(pass by reference)
*{@link shallowAndDeepCopy}

**6. 
In a statically typed language the type of the variable should be known at the compile time Eg: int a => in "C"
Whereas in a dynamically typed  such as JS, a variable can receive different values at the runtime and thus the type of the variable is known only at the runtime

//*In essence, BigInt allows for storing large integers. If bigInts are not used, a large numeric literal would be converted into a floating point and lose precision of the least significant digits.
//A BigInt is created by appending n to the end of an integer literal or by calling the function BigInt().

//*When to use BigInt ??
/*
Anything below Number.MIN_SAFE_INTEGER and above Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER can be represented in BigInt
We will get a warning 
Numeric literals with absolute values equal to 2^53 or greater are too large to be represented accurately as integers.

 **ECMA Definition :
 The Symbol type is the set of all non-String values that may be used as the key of an Object property

 Symbols return a value thatâ€™s guaranteed to be unique(most of the cases)
 .
 The internal value of symbol is hidden from the code and cannot be obtained

//! Eg:2
const sym11 = new Symbol()
//op => Type Error
/*
Symbol is a primitive type.  Its instances are mainly used as unique property keys.
An instance can only be created by using Symbol as a function. Using Symbol with the new operator will raise a TypeError.
This prevents programmers from creating an explicit Symbol wrapper object instead of a new Symbol value.
If "new Symbol()" is allowed then typeof sym11 will be an object

const asdf = Symbol("praveen")
